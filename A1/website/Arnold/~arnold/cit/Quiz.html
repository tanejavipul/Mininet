<h3>Some Practice Problems</h3>
<p>Please consider the following problems. They are meant to test
familiarity with some language features. 
<!-- We also may discuss
some of these problems when discussing some of the non-Object Oriented features
of Java. -->
<p>
<!-- 
I would like you to submit the quiz (email your answers to
arnold@cs.toronto.edu Subject: quiz) so I can
take results and use them for planning the structure of the course. 
This diagnostic type of quiz is for my purposes.  I would like to
maximize the learning time by creating heterogeneous groupings so
that you can learn and assist one another throughout the week.  It
also gives you an opportunity to share ideas and teaching strategies
with other teachers from different areas.
-->

<p>If you have any questions about the quiz, primes or any 
programming language features (ie if statements,
loops, procedures/functions, recursion etc.) please let me know and
we can point you to some background material to get you warmed up.
<p>

<li> <b>IsPrime(integer n)</b>
	<p><b>Background:</b> An number n &gt; 1 is prime if and only if
		its only divisors are 1 and itself.
	<br><b>Input:</b> n an integer which is greater than 1
	<br><b>Output:</b> returns true if n is a prime number and false
			otherwise
	<br><b>Example:</b> 
		<ul>
		<li>IsPrime(3) returns true
		<li>IsPrime(4) returns false
		<li>IsPrime(5) returns true
		<li>IsPrime(6) returns false
		<li>IsPrime(7) returns true
		<li>IsPrime(8) returns false
		</ul>
	<br><br>
<li> <b>AllPairs(integer n)</b>
	<br><b>Input:</b> n an integer, n &gt;= 0
	<br><b>Output:</b> prints out 
	<pre>
	(0,0)
	(1,0)(1,1)
	(2,0)(2,1)(2,2)
	(3,0)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)
	...
	(n,0)(n,1)...(n,n-1)(n,n)
	</pre>

<li> <b>Balloon</b> (<i>Note:</i> We will be reviewing the ideas here in depth
in the Advanced course, but let me know if you have difficulty with this).

<p>A Balloon has a volume, capacity and knows whether it has been popped. 
You can inflate the balloon (by a specified amount) and deflate the 
balloon (also by a specified amount). A Balloon can not be inflated 
once it has popped. Once popped, its capacity and volume should be 0. 
A balloon pops because of over inflation. By default, 
Balloons come from the factory in the following state: Not popped, capacity=20, volume=0.
<p>
Write class Balloon. Each instance of Balloon should behave as described above. 
Write class UseBalloon (which has a main method). 
UseBalloon.main() should create a few balloons, pop some of them and 
try to blow them up again.

<li> <b>Buyable(integer n)</b>
	<p><b>Background:</b> At McDonalds, you can only purchase 6,9 and 20 packs
		of McNuggets. Call an amount of McNuggets <i>buyable</i> if it is
		possible to purchase some number of 6,9 and 20 packs and total the 
		target amount.
	<p> For example 0, 6, 15, 18 are all buyable. 10 and 11 are not buyable.
	<br><b>Input:</b> n an integer
	<br><b>Output:</b> returns true if n is a buyable amount, false otherwise
	<br><b>Example:</b> 
		<ul>
		<li>Buyable(0) returns true
		<li>Buyable(6) returns true
		<li>Buyable(15) returns true
		<li>Buyable(18) returns true
		<li>Buyable(10) returns false
		<li>Buyable(11) returns false
		</ul>
	<br><b>Algorithm:</b> Implement the following recursive algorithm
	<pre>
	if n &lt; 0 then n is not buyable
	if n=0 then n is buyable
	if one of n-6, n-9 or n-20 is buyable then so is n
	</pre>
	<br>
	<br>
<!--
<li> <b>NPrimes(integer n)</b>
	<br><b>Input:</b> n is an integer bigger than 0
	<br><b>Output:</b> The first n primes are printed out
	<br><b>Example:</b> 
		<ul>
		<li>NPrimes(1) prints out 2
		<li>NPrimes(2) prints out 2,3
		<li>NPrimes(3) prints out 2,3,5
		<li>NPrimes(4) prints out 2,3,5,7
		</ul>
	<br><b>Algorithm:</b> 
	<pre>
	Maintain an array P of size n
	P will contain the first n Primes
	nextInt=2
	while(P is not full){
		if(nextInt is not divisible by any of the primes in P)then
			add nextInt to P
		end if
		nextInt=nextInt+1
	}
	Print array P
	</pre>
